# Online-Payments-Fraud-Detection
Author Tushar Mendiratta


The problem

To identify online payment fraud with machine learning, we need to train a machine learning model for classifying fraudulent and non-fraudulent
payments.

Project Overview


The introduction of online payment systems has helped a lot in the ease of payments. But, at the same time, it increased in payment frauds.
Online payment frauds can happen with anyone using any payment system, especially while making payments using a credit card. That is why
detecting online payment fraud is very important for credit card companies to ensure that the customers are not getting charged for the products 
and services they never paid. In this project, I will build a machine learning model using python to detect online payments fraud.

Online Payments Fraud Detection with Machine Learning

To identify online payment fraud with machine learning, we need to train a machine learning model for classifying fraudulent and non-fraudulent 
payments. For this, we need a dataset containing information about online payment fraud, so that we can understand what type of transactions 
lead to fraud.
